# Funny Animation Project

A humorous animation project that brings to life a human and a dog through a series of funny movements.

## Description

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple animation that showcases a human and a dog performing various actions. The animation is triggered by a series of buttons that, when clicked, change the images displayed to create a funny sequence of movements.

## Features

- A human character that can be made to jump, run, and perform other funny actions
- A dog character that can be made to run, jump, and perform other humorous movements
- A series of buttons that trigger the animations
- A simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to interact with the characters

## Code Highlights

- The `img` elements are used to display the character images, which are swapped out to create the animation effect.
- The `button` elements are used to trigger the animations, which are defined in the `script.js` file.
- The `script.js` file uses JavaScript to change the `src` attribute of the `img` elements to create the animation effect.

## Example Use Case

This project can be used as a starting point for more complex animations or games that use character sprites. It can also be used to create humorous and engaging interactive experiences for users.

## Note

The project uses external image files, which are linked to in the HTML code. Make sure to update the image URLs if you plan to use this project in a different environment.
